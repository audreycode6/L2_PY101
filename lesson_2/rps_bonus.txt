1. Lizard Spock This game is a variation on the Rock Paper Scissors game that 
adds two more options - Lizard and Spock. 
The goal of this bonus is to add Lizard and Spock to your game.
    Rules:
    # Rules:
#     spock > scissors
#     spock > rock

#     lizard > Spock
#     lizard > paper

#     scissors > paper
#     scissors > lizard

#     paper > rock
#     paper > spock

#     rock > scissors
#     rock > lizard

2. Shortened Input Typing the full word "rock" or "lizard" is tiring. 
Update the program so the user can type "r" for "rock," "p" for "paper," 
and so on. 
    options for input: full word OR first letter (first 2 letters for scissors and spock)
    rock = ['rock', 'r']
    paper = [ 'paper', 'p']
    scissors = ['scissors', 'sc']
    lizard = ['lizard', 'l']
    spock = ['spock', 'sp']
3. Best of Five Keep score of the player's and computer's wins. 
When either the player or computer reaches three wins, the match is over, 
and the winning player becomes the grand winner. 
Don't add your incrementing logic to display_winner. Keep your functions simple; 
they should perform one logical task -- no more, no less.
    rounds = 0
    user_score = 0
    computer_score = 0
    set variables 
    while round <= 5:
        increment winner by 1, increment round each time
        if __score == 3:
        return winner
        else return results
